If you have difficulty running the program due to issues with Pygame, ensure that you have correctly installed and updated this import:
- If you do not have Pygame installed, run `python3 -m pip install -U pygame --user` in the terminal
- Try setting your python interpreter is set to Python 3.11.2
- If you have Pygame and are still experiencing issues, consult the <a href="https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted">Pygame wiki</a>
